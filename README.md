# Framework

This is my own framework. I kept it simple because I am new to all of the elements of this project but I am learning more every day. I added 6 elements in addition to having Buttons, Grid layout, and a Form design:
  * Navigation Bar
  * Card
  * Header styles
  * Blockquote style
  * Code block
  * Footer

# Navbar

This navigation bar has a professional and sleek design with a slate-grey-blue background color and white text that can be used in many settings. I chose to place the 'LOGO' in the center so it is the main focal point of each navbar. The default navbar design today normally has the logo in the top left and menu options to the right as a default. I wanted to create a symmetrical design and try something different.

# Card

My card is a simple example of a box you can fill with anything you like. I've placed one of my buttons inside to show this effect. It has a nice thin border to indicate its' thresholds which can be changed depending on your choice of grid columns.

# Header Styles

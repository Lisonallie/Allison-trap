# Framework

This is my own framework. I kept it simple because I am new to all of the elements of this project but I am learning more every day. I added 6 elements in addition to having Buttons, Grid layout, and Form design:
1. Navigation Bar
2. Card
3. Header
4. Blockquote
5. Code block
6. Footer

### Navbar

This navigation bar has a professional and sleek design with a slate-grey-blue background color and white text that can be used in many settings. I chose to place the **LOGO** in the center so it is the main focal point of each navbar. The default navbar design today normally has the logo in the top left and menu options to the right as a default. I wanted to create a symmetrical design and try something different.

### Card

My card is a simple example of a box you can fill with anything you like. I've placed one of my buttons inside to show this effect. It has a nice thin border to indicate its' thresholds which can be changed depending on your choice of grid columns.

### Header

I wanted to create some unique-looking styles for headers that would stand out. I tried to provide different styles and emphasis for different users.

### Blockquote

I wanted to design a blockquote that would easily stand out from the page. In one of my earlier assignments when I was learning all the elements still, I created a blockquote with a border and the instructions said that it looked ~~ugly~~bad in the initial placement of CSS and told us how to change it to make it look nice. Therefore, I thought "Why not make the nice-looking quote the default?".

### Code Block

Every website has their own aesthetic for how they want a code block to stand out. I kept the default font because it gets the message across as-is. I did however decide to darken the background of the code because the default is barely noticeable. I gave it a nice dark color in unison with my navbar design.

### Footer

The footer design of my framework is made to let whichever company it concerns do more. Usually a footer is all links to social media or other platforms. The footer is the last content a user sees when they finish scrolling a page. I thought it would be nice if the company had space to put a message for the visitors to their website. The links, which are a given in footers, are placed to the sides where they are noticeable but not overbearing, and the company has space to write a 'farewell' or whatever they want in the remaining space.

##### Using My Framework's Grid System

Using this system is fairly straightforward as I have a 6x6 column setup with unlimited row choice. I eliminated the center section because it didn't end up condusive to the design. So I tried something different and made the grid simple.
